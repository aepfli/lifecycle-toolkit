### standardizing access for all Observability Data for K8s

To drive decisions based on metrics use Keptn Metrics Server to:

* Define Keptn Metrics once for Dynatrace, DataDog, AWS, Azure, GCP, ...
* Access all those metrics via Prometheus or K8s Metric API
* Eliminate the need of multiple plugins for Argo Roolouts, KEDA, HPA, ...
